# Security Article Search MCP Server on Cloudflare

A remote MCP server that provides access to 4000+ security articles with advanced search capabilities, deployed on Cloudflare Workers with OAuth authentication.

## Features

- üîç **Advanced Search**: Query 4000+ security articles across 40+ fields
- üõ°Ô∏è **OAuth Authentication**: Secure access with Cloudflare OAuth Provider  
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloudflare R2 Storage**: Efficient storage for large metadata
- üöÄ **6 Powerful Tools**:
  - `get_workflow_instructions`: Learn the correct search workflow
  - `show_searchable_fields`: Discover all searchable fields
  - `get_field_values`: Get exact field values for filtering
  - `query_articles`: Search articles with complex filters
  - `get_article_details`: Get full article information
  - `show_field_values`: Compatibility alias for field values

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Cloudflare account with Workers and R2 enabled
- Wrangler CLI (`npm install -g wrangler`)
- The original `search_metadata.json` file from your Python MCP

## Setup & Installation

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Login to Cloudflare
npx wrangler login

# 3. Upload metadata to R2 (creates bucket automatically)
npm run setup

# 4. Run locally for testing
npm run dev
```

You should be able to open [`http://localhost:8787/`](http://localhost:8787/) in your browser

## Connect the MCP inspector to your server

To explore your new MCP api, you can use the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector).

- Start it with `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`
- [Within the inspector](http://localhost:5173), switch the Transport Type to `SSE` and enter `http://localhost:8787/sse` as the URL of the MCP server to connect to, and click "Connect"
- You will navigate to a (mock) user/password login screen. Input any email and pass to login.
- You should be redirected back to the MCP Inspector and you can now list and call any defined tools!

## Connect Claude Desktop to your local MCP server

The MCP inspector is great, but we really want to connect this to Claude! Follow [Anthropic's Quickstart](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) and within Claude Desktop go to Settings > Developer > Edit Config to find your configuration file.

Open the file in your text editor and replace it with this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "security-search": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://localhost:8787/sse"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This will run a local proxy and let Claude talk to your MCP server over HTTP

When you open Claude a browser window should open and allow you to login. You should see the tools available in the bottom right. Given the right prompt Claude should ask to call the tool.

</div>

</div>

## Deploy to Cloudflare

```bash
# 1. Create KV namespace for OAuth (if not already created)
npx wrangler kv namespace create OAUTH_KV
# Update the ID in wrangler.jsonc if needed

# 2. Ensure R2 bucket exists and data is uploaded
npm run upload-data

# 3. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
npm run deploy
```

After deployment, you'll receive a URL like: `https://security-article-search-mcp.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`

## Call your newly deployed remote MCP server from a remote MCP client

Just like you did above in "Develop locally", run the MCP inspector:

`npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@latest`

Then enter the `workers.dev` URL (ex: `worker-name.account-name.workers.dev/sse`) of your Worker in the inspector as the URL of the MCP server to connect to, and click "Connect".

You've now connected to your MCP server from a remote MCP client.

## Connect Claude Desktop to your remote MCP server

Update the Claude configuration file to point to your `workers.dev` URL and restart Claude.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Use `mcp-remote` (NOT `@cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare`)
- Replace `your-account` with your actual Cloudflare account name
- Remove any local Python MCP configs to avoid duplicate tools

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "security-search-remote": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://remote-mcp-server.your-account.workers.dev/sse"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Debugging

Should anything go wrong it can be helpful to restart Claude, or to try connecting directly to your
MCP server on the command line with the following command.

```bash
npx mcp-remote http://localhost:8787/sse
```

In some rare cases it may help to clear the files added to `~/.mcp-auth`

```bash
rm -rf ~/.mcp-auth
```
